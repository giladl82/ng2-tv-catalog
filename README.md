# ng2-tv-catalog
An angular 2 tv catalog. 

This is my first ng2 application so go easy on me ;)

Some of my decision where made for the sake of learning.
For example, separating the components as I did.
I actually didn't see any separation and I think that in an app this small, all the files could of been placed in the same folder,
but I wanted to see how separating them to different folders will effect my code.
